This is my PhD thesis. It aims to explore a novel gamut extension algorithm capable of expanding a sRGB(BT.709) image to the desitination gamut of Adobe RGB or BT.2020. 
Additionally, it provides users with greater flexibility to subjectively control the intensity of the saturation ratio. The slide below is the summary of the thesis.
